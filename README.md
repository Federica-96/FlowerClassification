# FlowerClassification
## CNN for Flower Classification


Original dataset is taken by Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

I made available also at this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cDrRvTrvw_qXGD68I3b3TGTDwSXEcRP1/view?usp=sharing
And if you use my import data code you will not need to download this file in your pc.

__The aim of the work__ is to build a classification model to recognize flowers with CNN.

I tried several experiments with different number of convolutional layers which I trained in various ways (different values of stride, padding, etc.).
At the end the best model result to be composed by 3 Conv Layers and 3 Dense Layers.
